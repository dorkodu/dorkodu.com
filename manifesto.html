            how we put
            our values into practice. Our work at Dorkodu is measured against the highest possible standards of
            ethical business conduct. Our commitment to our deepest values helps us hire great people, build great
            products, and attract loyal users.</p>

          <h2 class="underlined-title">Our Culture</h2>

          <p><b>Dorkodu is not a conventional company.</b> We do not intend to be one. Throughout Dorkodu's evolution,
            we have always tried to be unique. We have also emphasized an atmosphere of creativity, freedom and
            challenge, which helps us providing people unbiased, accurate and free access to useful and
            meaningful knowledge.</p>

          <p>I founded Dorkodu because I believed we could provide a service to the humanity - instantly delivering
            true and useful information on any topic. Serving our users is at the heart of what we do, and
            remains our number one priority.</p>

          <p>We create products that we are proud of, and we hope in the future they will have even greater positive
            impact on the humanity. </p>

          <!-- opinions on running a business -->
          <h3 class="underlined-title">Business, Risks and Rewards</h3>

          <p>If opportunities arise that might cause us to sacrifice short term results but are in the best long term
            interest of our users, we will take those opportunities.</p>

          <p>We make business decisions with the long term welfare of our company, users and shareholders in mind, but
            not based on accounting considerations.</p>

          <p>Our business environment changes rapidly and needs long-term investment. We won't hesitate to place major
            bets on promising new opportunities.</p>

          <p>We won't shy away from risky but high-reward projects because of the short-term earnings pressure. This
            means we need a growing income to satisfy our growing ambitions in our revolutionary work.</p>

          <!-- opinions on managing, company structure -->
          <h3 class="underlined-title">Executive Roles & Structure</h3>

          <p>We have a flat-like hierarchy in the company. We don't have industry-standart, cliche titles and management
            patterns. Our way is unique; simple but effective. As always how we desire.</p>

          <p>For each high-level need that we have in the company, we create a branch. We list the specific
            missions, goals and requirements for that branch. Then we assign them to squads. One's roles can change but
            the purpose and mission in the foundation can't.</p>

          <p>Each squad has a leader, who is the most experienced person that can see the big picture without missing
            the details. Everyone reports to their squad leader.</p>

          <p>If you are a squad leader, you report to your branch lead. Branch leads report to the "board of leads"
            which they are also the members of.</p>

          <p><strong>The Chief</strong> is the true leader of the foundation and makes decisions under the guidance of the board of
            leads.</p>

          <h3 class="underlined-title">Work Life</h3>

          <p>Dorkodu is not so much a job as it is a way of life. You don't forget about work at the end of a day, when
            you leave work you still think about it; not because you have deadlines or because you have to, but because
            you are excited about what you are doing.</p>

          <p>Everyone has a mission based on their experience, personality and knowledge. Tasks and roles are assigned
            you based on your mission and purpose in your squad.</p>

          <p><strong>Your role is limited only by your energy and passion, not by your title.</strong></p>

          <p>
            If you want to create a new
            product, it is yours to build. If you want to contribute on another product, just speak up. The energy and
            passion of the people working around you here is a constant reminder of how much we all believe in what we
            are doing.
          </p>

          <p>For example, even if you are a graphic designer, you can work with engineers on a technical project. It
            doesn't matter if you don't have expertise in that area, if you feel interest and passion about that, go
            that way. Your creative and useful ideas will be appreciated.</p>

          <!-- dorkodians, employees -->
          <h3 class="underlined-title">Dorkodians</h3>
          <p>Our workmates are everything. Everyone at Dorkodu is called a "Dorkodian". We are
            focused on attracting and leveraging the talent of exceptional thinkers. We have been
            lucky to see many creative, principled, idealist, determined, high-working people.</p>

          <p>Because of our talents, we can do exciting work in every knowledge-related field. Talented people are
            interested in Dorkodu because we empower them to change the destiny of human civilization.</p>
          <p>Our main benefit is a workplace with meaningful projects, where our workmates can contribute and grow while
            enjoying the feeling of creating the tomorrow. Those contributions make Dorkodu better in our great journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="--highlight">
              &nbsp;We encourage our workmates, in addition to their 80% regular work time, to spend 20% of their time
              working on what they think will most benefit the humanity. This lets them to be more innovative and
              creative. Many of our advances have happened in this manner.&nbsp;

            civilisation.</p>
          <p>In pursuing our ambitious goals, we will always be mindful of our responsibilities to our users, workmates
            and shareholders. With our products, Dorkodu connects the human with knowledge.</p>
          <p>This is a critical mission that should be accomplished by a dedicated, trustworthy and
