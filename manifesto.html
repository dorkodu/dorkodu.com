          <h2 class="underlined-title">Our Culture</h2>
          <p><b>Dorkodu is not a conventional company.</b> We do not intend to be one. Throughout Dorkodu's evolution, we have always been unique. We have also emphasized an atmosphere of creativity, freedom and challenge, which has helped us provide unbiased, accurate and free access to information for people who is in search for anything.</p>
          <p>I founded Dorkodu because I believed we could provide a service to the humanity - instantly delivering true, pure and relevant information on any topic. Serving our users is at the heart of what we do, and remains our number one priority.</p>
          <p>We are proud of the products we create and we hope in the future they will have even greater positive impact on the humanity. </p>
          <!-- our opinion on running a business -->
          <h3 class="underlined-title">Business, Risks and Rewards</h3>
          <p>If opportunities arise that might cause us to sacrifice short term results but are in the best long term interest of our shareholders and users, we will take those opportunities.</p>
          <p>We make business decisions with the long term welfare of our company and shareholders in mind, but not based on accounting considerations.</p>
          <p>Our business environment changes rapidly and needs long-term investment. We won't hesitate to place major bets on promising new opportunities.</p>
          <p>We won't shy away from risky but high-reward projects because of the short-term earnings pressure. This means we need a growing income to satisfy our growing ambitions in our revolutionary work.</p>
          <!-- opinion on managing, company structure -->
          <h3 class="underlined-title">Executive Roles & Structure</h3>
          <p>We have a flat-like hierarchy in the company. We don't have industry-standart, cliche titles, management patterns. Our way is simple.</p>
          <p>For each high-level need that we have in the company, we create a branch. We make a list of specific missions, goals and requirements for that branch. Then we assign them to squads. One's roles can change but the purpose and mission in the foundation can't.</p>
          <p>Each squad has a leader, who is the most experienced person who can see the big picture without missing the details. Everyone reports to their squad leader.</p>
          <p>If you are a squad leader, you report to your branch lead. A branch lead reports to the board of leads which they are also the members of. The Chief is the true leader of the foundation and makes decisions under the guidance of the board of leads.</p>
          <h3 class="underlined-title">Work Life</h3>
          <p>Dorkodu is not so much a job as it is a way of life. You don't forget about work at the end of a day, when you leave work you still think about it; not because you have deadlines or because you have to, but because you are excited about what you are doing.</p>
          <p>Your role is limited only by your energy and passion, not by your title. If you want to create a new product, it is yours to build. If you want to contribute on another product, just speak up. The energy and passion of the people working around you here is a constant reminder of how much we all believe in what we are doing.</p>
          <p>For example, even if you are a graphic designer, you can work with engineers on a technical project. It doesn't matter if you don't have expertise in that area, if you feel interest and passion about that, go that way. Your creative and useful ideas will be appreciated.</p>
          <p>Everyone has a mission based on their experience, personality and knowledge. Tasks and roles are assigned you based on your mission and purpose in your squad.</p>
          <!-- dorkodians, employees -->
          <h3 class="underlined-title">Dorkodians</h3>

          <p>Because of our talents, we can do exciting work in every knowledge-related field. Talented people are interested in Dorkodu because we empower them to change the world.</p>
          <p>Our main benefit is a workplace with meaningful projects, where our employees can contribute and grow while enjoying the feeling of working for the tomorrow. Those contributors make Dorkodu better in our journey living on our purpose.</p>

          <h2 class="underlined-title">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>When I founded Dorkodu, I hoped it would reach a universal influence. Our intense and interest was to help people find, discover, exchange and use pure and true knowledge.</p>
