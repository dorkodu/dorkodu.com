        <h2>Our Work Culture</h2>
        Opportunity is Knocking







        Join us!



        As a team, we are NOT optimising for happiness. Our goal is to maximise meaning. We don’t have a fancy office,
        don’t offer free meals, back-rubs or any other perks you can find in the industry. We wish, but not yet.

        What we offer is the adventure of your lifetime.

        - The chance to work on a product that can significantly improve society.
        - The chance to do the best work of your life.
        <h3>Be bright. Be you.</h3>
      

        Great Product. Happy Customers.

        It all starts with the right team, which in turn starts with awesome people. We are looking for purposeful,
        ambitious, self-driven individuals, who are passionate about the problem we are working on.

        We don’t have a schedule. You can contribute when you feel you are most productive. And most of the team is
        remote. That has some advantages but it comes with responsibilities:



        Take ownership

        We step up and get stuff done. We all know that things will not happen unless we work for it. There are tons of
        projects that need to get done and we all apply our skills to advance them.



        Show your work

        Results matter more than anything. We let the work do the talking most of the time.



        Act with urgency

        We’re focused on making quick decisions and executing fast. “How can this be done sooner?” is the mantra which
        we live by.



        Over-communicate

        We speak up & have no patience for silent disagreements. We prefer healthy debates. And we all let our
        colleagues know what goes through our minds.

        Why the hell would you sign up for something like this?

        Seems like a demanding job description, doesn’t it? Why would you do it?

        - Because you need a purpose in your life. Because working a 9-5 job, in large team, detached by the effects of
        your efforts sounds awful to you. Because you want your work to matter!
        - Because you understand that assuming responsibility is the only way to grow and develop yourself. Muscles
        don’t grow while you Netflix and chill on your sofa, but through the pain and sweat in the gym. The same is true
        for your career and your life.
        - Because you will be part of an awesome team of diverse top-performing individuals. And you understand that an
        entourage of self-driven people is the best gift for your future.
        - Because you are intelligent to know to never surrender your opportunity for security. You can always get a
        cozy secure job, but opportunities to join greatness are far in between.

        On the benefits side:

        - Be an early employee.
        - Join our high-growth startup to learn new skills and fast track your career growth; grow to be a company
        leader in the future, get management opportunities and run your team.
        - Market-level salary.
        - You can make your own schedule.
        - (As long as things happen on time and on spec.)
        - Remote first: We don’t care when and where you work from.
        - Potential for stock options package.

          <p>Our iterative work process helps us to think better, create better. We can achieve faster without trading
            off quality.</p>
        </div>
        <p>We <strong>debate, decide then commit.</strong> We move fast and stay lean, but act with purpose. We bring
          intent and insight to every work we do. We know we won't always get it right, but we are not afraid to learn
          from experiences.</p>
